## Introduction
Pose estimation is the process of detecting and tracking the positions of a set of key points (or landmarks) that describe the pose of a person or object. In the context of human pose estimation, these key points typically correspond to joints such as elbows, knees, and shoulders.

## How Pose Estimation Models Work
Pose estimation models can be categorized into two main types: top-down and bottom-up approaches.

### Top-Down Approaches
Top-down approaches first detect humans in the image using an object detection model and then perform pose estimation for each detected human. These methods are accurate but computationally intensive.

Key steps:
1. **Human Detection**: Detect human bounding boxes in the image.
2. **Pose Estimation**: Predict key points within each detected bounding box.

### Bottom-Up Approaches
Bottom-up approaches detect all key points in the image first and then group them into individual poses. These methods are typically faster and more efficient but can be less accurate in crowded scenes.

Key steps:
1. **Key Point Detection**: Detect all key points in the image.
2. **Grouping**: Group detected key points into individual poses.

## Advantages of Pose Estimation
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enables intuitive control and interaction in various applications.
- **Sports Analysis**: Assists in analyzing athletic performance and preventing injuries.
- **Animation and AR**: Facilitates realistic animation and augmented reality experiences.
- **Surveillance**: Enhances security and monitoring systems by understanding human activities.
